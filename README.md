# 100-DAYS-OF-PYTHON
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python instructed by ChatGPT challenge!
This repository documents my daily progress as I learn and build projects in Python â€” one day at a time.
Each day includes a short coding exercise, a practical project, and GitHub commits to track consistency.

ðŸ“… Goal

By the end of 100 days, I will:
	â€¢	Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals.
	â€¢	Build 15â€“20 small projects (games, tools, web apps).
	â€¢	Learn Git, GitHub workflows, and collaborative coding.
	â€¢	Develop a complete portfolio of Python work.
